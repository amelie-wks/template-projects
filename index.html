         <h3>History</h3>
          <p>Despite the fact that the Northern Inuit Dog has only existed for around 30 to 40 years, their exact origin is a subject of controversial debate. While impossible to confirm exactly when and where they came from, there are two stories which appear to be most probable. One suggestion is that the breed was developed by a man called Eddie Harrison. In the 1980s, they claim he bred together rescue dogs of varying pedigree, including Siberian Huskies, German Shepherds and Alaskan Malamutes. However, another likely theory is that the breed originated a decade earlier, in the 1970s. It is presumed that Canadian Eskimo Dogs and Labrador Huskies were bred together in the USA after being imported from the UK.

        <h4>Are they actual wolfdogs?</h4>
        <p>While this breed is definitely a wolf look-alike, it is important to emphasise that they do not possess any wolf DNA. Whatever the true content of the Northern Inuit Dog, they were purposely bred to closely resemble wolves, while being domesticated enough to fulfil the role of a family pet. Despite having a cult following thanks to their recent appearance on the Game of Thrones TV series, as well as being part of The Northern Inuit Society, this newly developed breed is not recognised by any international governing bodies yet. The Northern Inuit Society have ensured that the Northern Inuit Dogs have not been bred to other dog breeds, ensuring their pedigree is maintained. While traditionally bred in the UK and Ireland, there has recently been a surge in the exportation of this breed and dogs have now made it as far afield as South Africa and Switzerland.</p>

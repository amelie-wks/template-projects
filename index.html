         <h3>History</h3>
          <p>Despite the fact that the Northern Inuit Dog has only existed for around 30 to 40 years, 
            their exact origin is a subject of controversial debate. While impossible to confirm exactly 
            when and where they came from, there are two stories which appear to be most probable. One suggestion
            is that the breed was developed by a man called Eddie Harrison. In the 1980s, they claim he bred together
            rescue dogs of varying pedigree, including Siberian Huskies, German Shepherds and Alaskan Malamutes. 
            However, another likely theory is that the breed originated a decade earlier, in the 1970s. It is presumed 
            that Canadian Eskimo Dogs and Labrador Huskies were bred together in the USA after being imported from the UK.</p>

      <div class="box-4">
        <h6>Are they actual wolfdogs?</h6>
        <p>While this breed is definitely a wolf look-alike, it is important to emphasise that they do not 
          possess any wolf DNA. Whatever the true content of the Northern Inuit Dog, they were purposely 
          bred to closely resemble wolves, while being domesticated enough to fulfil the role of a family pet.
          Despite having a cult following thanks to their recent appearance on the Game of Thrones TV series, as well
          as being part of The Northern Inuit Society, this newly developed breed is not recognised by any international 
          governing bodies yet. The Northern Inuit Society have ensured that the Northern Inuit Dogs have not been bred 
          to other dog breeds, ensuring their pedigree is maintained. While traditionally bred in the UK and Ireland,
          there has recently been a surge in the exportation of this breed and dogs have now made it as far afield as 
          South Africa and Switzerland.</p>

        <h5>Appearance</h5>
        <p>The Northern Inuit Dog should be of an athletic build and are a medium to large sized dog.
          Female dogs will typically reach heights of 59-71cms, while male dogs stand noticeably taller at around 64-81cms.
          They should be slightly taller than they are long. They should weigh between 25-38kgs for females and 36-48kgs
          for males. Their coat is quite thick and it should be a weather-proof double coat that measures about 4cms in length. 
          Their coat colour varies and may be pure white, sable, grey, apricot, black or varying shades in between. Coloured 'masks' 
          on the facial fur are permitted, though not if the dog is white-furred.</p>
          <p>Their head should be well proportioned, with their muzzle the same length as their skull. Their ears should stand 
          erect rather than flopping forwards and should not be overly big. Their eyes are oval in shape and may be 
          any colour. Their tail has a dense covering of fur and may have a crescent shape when the dog is moving. The tail 
          itself should not be curly or overly long.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box-7">
        <h6>Character and Temperament</h6>
        <p>Breeders and fanciers of this breed have worked hard to ensure that they are friendly and a confident dog. In fact, 
          they are such good-tempered animals, that they have been used successfully as therapy dogs. Leaving this breed of dog
          on their own for long periods of time is definitely not recommended, as they thoroughly enjoy being in the company of humans and 
          can be prone to developing separation anxiety. Dedicated to their families, they form strong bonds early on in the relationship, 
          and tend to have great respect for the 'alpha' or more dominant owner.</p>
          <p>It is widely reported that Northern Inuit Dogs do not make guard dogs as they are generally overly-trusting of people they 
            don't know. While these dogs have a reputation for being good with children, due to their sheer size and strength, interactions 
            should always be supervised. Howling is instinctive within this breed, and anyone with neighbours nearby should strongly consider 
            this before bringing home a Northern Inuit Dog.</p>

        <h6>Trainability</h6>
        <p>Northern Inuit Dogs require an experienced owner who is willing to put in the time and effort to bring them to their full potential. 
          Their sheer strength, intelligence and tendency to bore easily makes for a difficult pet when in the wrong hands. They are strong-willed 
          dogs who tend to have a mind of their own. However, they can be overly sensitive, and need to work with someone who is patient and 
          understanding.</p>
          <p>Trainers must work hard to ensure training sessions remain fresh and fun, as these dogs can easily become distracted and are not 
            likely to follow instructions when not interested. It is vital to begin their training as early as possible to ensure their 
            obediance. Caution is advised if training off-lead as they have retained their hunting instinct when it comes to small, 
            speedy prey, such as squirrels and rabbits.</p>

        <h6>Health</h6>
        <p>The Northern Inuit Society have made hip scoring and elbow scoring, as well as eye testing, a mandatory part of their 
          breeding programme - an example that many societies should follow. Anecdotally, they are a healthy breed with owners claiming 
          impressive life spans of 12 to 15 years. Medical conditions reported within the population include:</p>
          <h4>Orthopaedic Conditions</h4>
          <p>Many medium to large sized dogs are prone to developing elbow and hip dysplasia with the Northern Inuit Dog being no exception.
             When joints form improperly, they lead to localised pain and inflammation over time. Affected animals will show lameness that 
             worsens as they age.</p>
             <h4>Achondroplasia</h4>
             <p>There have been several reported cases of this form of dwarfism in the breed. Animals that are affected should not 
              be bred from.</p>
              <h4>Cryptorchidism</h4>
              <p>The failure of testicles to descend into the scrotum is not an unusual occurrence and is seen commonly within clinical practice. 
                One or both testicles may fail to descend, and the failure may be complete or partial. A testicle that does not descend completely 
                is at higher risk of cancer due to the increased temperature within the body and should be surgically removed once the dog has 
                reached maturity. While a dog who only has one undescended testicle will technically be fertile, breeding is ill-advised as this 
                is a genetic condition.</p>
                <h4>Degenerative Myelopathy</h4>
                <p>According to the Northern Inuit Society's website, there have been a number of breed members that have been reported as carriers
                  of this debilitating disease. An affected animal will have a worsening lameness of the hind limbs that is not associated with any
                  pain or discomfort.</p>
